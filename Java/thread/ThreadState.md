# 线程状态

[java-jvm-jstack-线程状态](http://wangxinchun.iteye.com/blog/2366853)

## RUNNABLE：正在执行的线程

注意：这里执行是针对jvm来说的，并非真的在cpu上执行，这要看操作系统处理器是否有机会
 
 
## BLOCKED:阻塞的线程

注意：阻塞的线程一般是拿不到监视器锁（a monitor lock），比如：synchronized block/method，ReentrantLock.lock()

## WAITING:等待状态
一般以下三种调用：
Object.wait with no timeout 
Thread.join with no timeout 
LockSupport.park 

## TIMED_WAITING：等待特定时间

情况分析(Block的时候已经有说明)
Thread.sleep 
Object.wait with timeout 
Thread.join with timeout 
LockSupport.parkNanos 
LockSupport.parkUntil
