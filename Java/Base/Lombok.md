val
Finally! Hassle-free final local variables.
@NonNull
or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the NullPointerException.
@Cleanup
Automatic resource management: Call your close() methods safely with no hassle.
@Getter/@Setter
Never write public int getFoo() {return foo;} again.
@ToString
No need to start a debugger to see your fields: Just let lombok generate a toString for you!
@EqualsAndHashCode
Equality made easy: Generates hashCode and equals implementations from the fields of your object..
@NoArgsConstructor, @RequiredArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor
Constructors made to order: Generates constructors that take no arguments, one argument per final / non-nullfield, or one argument for every field.
@Data
All together now: A shortcut for @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter on all fields, and @Setter on all non-final fields, and @RequiredArgsConstructor!
@Value
Immutable classes made very easy.
@Builder
... and Bob's your uncle: No-hassle fancy-pants APIs for object creation!
@SneakyThrows
To boldly throw checked exceptions where no one has thrown them before!
@Synchronized
synchronized done right: Don't expose your locks.
@Getter(lazy=true)
Laziness is a virtue!
@Log
Captain's Log, stardate 24435.7: "What was that line again?"
experimental
Head to the lab: The new stuff we're working on.
