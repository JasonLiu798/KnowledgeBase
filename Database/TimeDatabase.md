#InfluxDB

InfluxDB is an open source distributed time series database

there are two major types of time-series data:
Regular – data that is sampled at regular intervals. For example every second, or every hour.
Irregular – data that is only recorded when an event occurs, which might happen frequently, but always at completely random times.
